# Sales Analysis and Business Insights with SQL & Python
This project involved analyzing sales data to extract valuable insights and inform business decisions. Leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Python for visualization, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of sales performance across different regions, categories, and timeframes. The goal was to help the business understand top revenue-generating products, regional performance, and year-over-year growth, leading to data-driven strategies for revenue optimization and market expansion.

# Key Objectives:
Identify Top Revenue-Generating Products: Analyze product sales to uncover the highest revenue-driving products and categories.
Regional Sales Analysis: Determine the best-selling products in each region, helping to tailor regional marketing and sales efforts.
Year-over-Year Sales Growth Comparison: Compare monthly sales between 2022 and 2023 to highlight growth trends and areas for improvement.
Monthly Peak Sales per Category: Identify the best-performing months for each category to assist in seasonal planning and promotional strategies.
Profit Growth by Subcategory: Highlight subcategories with the highest profit growth between 2022 and 2023 to inform future product investments.

# Approach:
Sales Performance Analysis: I grouped and aggregated data by product, region, and time to uncover key performance trends. SQLâ€™s powerful analytical functions were used to identify top products, regional sales leaders, and monthly performance spikes.
Year-Over-Year Comparison: By comparing monthly sales data between 2022 and 2023, I tracked growth patterns, helping the business understand periods of strong and weak sales performance.
Python Data Visualization: Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn were used to create compelling visualizations that showcased sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance. This made it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders.

# Key Insights & Business Impact:
Top Products: The analysis revealed the top 10 revenue-generating products, allowing the company to focus on stocking and promoting high-performing products.
Regional Sales Performance: Insights into the highest-selling products by region enabled the business to optimize marketing efforts and product distribution strategies for different markets.
Growth Trends: The year-over-year comparison highlighted key months with significant sales growth, guiding decisions around seasonal promotions and budget allocation.
Subcategory Profit Growth: I identified subcategories with the highest profit growth, helping the business prioritize investments in product development and marketing for these areas.

# Tools & Technologies Used:
SQL: For querying, aggregating, and analyzing large datasets.
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn): For data visualization and deeper analysis of sales trends.
Jupyter Notebook: To seamlessly combine SQL queries and Python code for an efficient analysis workflow.

This project helps in understanding how different sub-categories performed year-over-year and highlights key insights using visual representations.
